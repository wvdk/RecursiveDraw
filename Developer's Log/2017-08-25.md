5:52 PM: The goal of this project is more or less to copy Toby Schachman's [Recursive Drawing](http://recursivedrawing.com) prototype. I think it's super cool and feel like messing around in that space. But before I can start exploring new ideas I need to have a similar level of functionality. Schanchman conveniently open sourced everything, but I don't like CoffeeScript or the JavaScript canvas, so I need to build it myself. I'm not trying to build an exact clone.
