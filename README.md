# RecursiveDraw

The goal of this project is more or less to copy Toby Schachman's [Recursive Drawing](http://recursivedrawing.com) prototype. I think it's super cool and feel like messing around in that space. But before I can start exploring new ideas I need to have a similar level of functionality. Schanchman conveniently [open sourced everything](https://github.com/electronicwhisper/recursive-drawing/), but I don't like CoffeeScript or the JavaScript canvas, so I need to build it myself. I'm not trying to build an exact clone. We'll see where this goes. Follow developement by reading the [Developer's Log](https://github.com/wvdk/RecursiveDraw/tree/master/Developer's%20Log). Although there are iOS, watchOS, and tvOS targets, I'm really only trying to get this to run on macOS right now.
